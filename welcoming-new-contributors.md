# Welcoming new Contributors to Enspiral - a suggested process

Every new [Contributor](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/agreements/people.md#contributors) to Enspiral is invited in by an Enspiral [Member](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/agreements/people.md#members). They are then assigned an official Buddy to be an additional support in welcoming them into the network. Existing Enspiral Members and Contributors can volunteer to be on the Buddy roster for 6-month periods ([see this Loomio decision](https://www.loomio.org/d/UOR1h9Px/evolving-the-buddy-system-for-new-enspiral-contributors-who-wants-to-be-on-the-enspiral-welcoming-crew-)). 

The first duty of being an Enspiral Buddy is to schedule in a meeting or skype call with the new Contributor. While they are free for the conversation to take any form they feel is most useful and meaningful, here's a process which has been tested as effective for helping orient new Contributors.

## Part 1 : The Interview 
This is where you ask the new Contributor about how they've come into the network, why they're here and what they'd like to contribute. It's a great idea to document their answers in a Google Doc or other format so they have it for their personal record. It's possible that this information could also be used at a later date to populate an online profile for the Contributor.

**Questions :**

1. What attracted you to Enspiral?
2. What is your intention coming in? What would success look like to you?
3. What do you think you might like to contribute? What skills are you bringing?

## Part 2 : Building connections
Based on what you learned in Part 1, suggest three people in the network that the new Contributor might like to connect with. Then empower them to make contact - this could be as simple as saying 'I'd recommend just pinging them on skype - I think they'd be really open to talking with you' or it could involve a personal introduction - either over email or in person.

## Part 3 : Tour of the house
If both parties are based in Wellington this could include Enspiral Space, otherwise it will just be a tour of our online spaces. The idea with this part is that itâ€™s the difference between getting given keys to a house and left to your own devices, and being given a personal tour about how everything works. It might also be worth referring them to the **[Enspiral Comms Guide](https://github.com/enspiral/guides/blob/master/comms.md)** at this time.

* **Enspiral website** - where to find essential info. Includes info.enspiral.com and Orientation Doc there.

* **Slack** - what channels they might like to join, what the pattern of interaction is, filling out their profiles.

* **Loomio** - what discussions are happening at the moment they might be interested in. Advice around commenting, starting discussions and attention economy.

* **Cobudget** - show them how to propose buckets and encourage them to comment on ideas other people have posted.

* **Chalkle** - ensure they've been able to log in and understand they can post events there.
