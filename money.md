# How money works at Enspiral

*Money moves like water when you don’t have a boss*

We reckon that decentralising the control of money is one of the most strategic things we can do to make the world a better place.

Financial literacy is power. In any organisation, the people that understand the flows of money have a huge influence on where that money gets spent. So we’ve invested in enhancing that literacy for everyone in the network.

At Enspiral we have developed a menagerie of tools and practices to translate that lofty ambition into a practical reality.

Most of us are freelancers earning our own money, but we all put some of that money "in the middle": a collective resource that we manage collaboratively.

As we’ve developed our tools and processes, we’ve seen that an increasing number of people have access to spend the money, and more people are contributing as well.

## How money comes in

The main sources of collective funds at Enspiral are from Services (freelancers and teams contributing around 20% of their income), Ventures (each venture has a unique agreement with the Foundation as to how much they contribute), and grants (e.g. Lifehack Project, Namaste Foundation).

## Our internal economy

We have a core piece of digital infrastructure called "my.enspiral" - it’s our homemade bank that holds our internal economy. Money can flow between different people and projects in Enspiral Services without ever leaving our collective bank account.

## How money gets spent

**Enspiral Foundation**

Each month collective funds are up for grabs. Any contributor can propose a project for funds to be spent on and the Members (shareholders of the Enspiral Foundation) each get an equal portion to spend. In this way we are investing our profits as a network back into our social mission.

**Ventures**

Lots of our Ventures have come up with creative ways of playing with money too.

**Methodology :**

1. In the middle of each month, Enspiral Services Contributors and Members are invited to submit what we call Bucket Proposals through our collaborative funding software [Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/). A proposal outlines a project that an Enspiralite wants to happen. The description consists of what they want to do and how it would benefit to the network. It’s their pitch to internal investors.

2. At the end of each month, Enspiral Ventures [contribute revenue](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TBTikOU27tXRb1H05LbZLyUUwYEV3Ph04gXlvDi9hE0/edit#gid=0) to the Enspiral Foundation collectuve funds as per their unique [Venture Agreement](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/agreements/ventures.md). Other sources of income to collective funds are through grant fund-holding e.g. [Lifehack Project](http://lifehackhq.co/), [Namaste Grant](http://www.namaste.org/blog/enspiral-open-source-society). 

3. Core fixed expenses agreed through [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/) decisions such as legal, accounting, tax, staffing are subtracted.

4. Bucket proposals are collated into a menu of options for investment.

5. Enspiral Ventures who had contributed revenue maintain control of their monthly contribution and decide within their organisation what they would like it spent on. This is sometimes done by a process of delegation (one person in the Venture is responsible for allocating), through [Dot-Voting](http://dotmocracy.org/dot-voting) on Loomio, or group decision made by consensus. 

6. Contributions that have come from other sources (e.g. grant fund-holding) are split equally between Enspiral Members (shareholders of the Enspiral Foundation) to invest. 

7. At the start of the new month, investment opens for one week for Ventures and Members to decide how to spend their contributions. Any funds that are not spent during this period get transferred to Reserves. Funds held in Reserves require a Loomio decision to be spent.

8. At the close of this period, people who have proposed buckets are informed by email that they have funds accessible. Buckets Sponsors that didn’t reach their target are given three options :

    1. Cancel the bucket, send allocated funds to reserves

    2. Progress the bucket with the amount of funds they received

    3. Hold the funds and propose the bucket again next round

9. Funds are released to Bucket Sponsors on completion of the project proposed and a short report on the outcome of the project is sent back to the Collaborative Funding team to be collated into our Collaborative Funding Annual Reports.
