This is an experimental new collection of "how Enspiral works" content. Stay tuned for updates.

## Foundational articles:

* [How Money Works at Enspiral](https://github.com/enspiral/guides/blob/master/money.md)
* [Collaborating Better](https://github.com/enspiral/guides/blob/master/collaborating-better.md)
* [Communications Guidelines](https://github.com/enspiral/guides/blob/master/comms.md)

**About these articles**

A "foundational article" is a landing page - an introduction to the concept, then a series of links to stories and recipes with more detailed information.

A **_Recipe_** is a piece of instructional ‘how-to’ content that gives enough detail that people can follow the process. The form we’ll be testing includes the following fields :

1. Title
2. Purpose of practice
3. Where it’s practiced (e.g. what Enspiral teams / ventures?)
4. Credits (developer / lineage)
5. Methodology

A **_Story_** is a narrative form which reveals the context and purpose from which the process or practice emerged. There are several different forms it could take e.g. **[I-Story](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/a-new-cultural-tech-8a5a092035af)** and we can provide framing questions to get the juicy bits out e.g.

* What was the problem you were grappling with?
* What were your breakthroughs in relating to that challenge?
* How did that change how you operate - what you did and how you did it?
* What impact has this change in practice had?
* What are the learning edges right now?
